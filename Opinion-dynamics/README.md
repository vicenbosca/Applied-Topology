# Opinion Dynamics

An investigation into opinion dynamics on discourse sheaves, based on the work of Hansen and Ghrist.

## Overview

This project explores the mathematical modeling of opinion dynamics using sheaf theory. The implementation focuses on analyzing 3-way interactions in opinion formation, extending beyond traditional pairwise models.

## Current Content

- `3-way_inter.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing symbolic computations for analyzing 3-way opinion dynamics using SymPy. This includes:
  - Computation of coboundary matrices and Laplacians
  - Analysis of kernels and convergence behavior
  - Extension of pairwise interaction models to 3-way interactions

## Based On

This work extends the ideas presented in:
> Jakob Hansen and Robert Ghrist. Opinion dynamics on discourse sheaves. _SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics_, 81(5):2033â€“2060, 2021
